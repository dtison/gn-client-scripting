    TODO's:
    1.  If job waits for hardware to become available - display QUEUED message - DONE
    2.  Some kind of default timeout range in case we never get server push?  is an error condition.
    3.  Synchronize all these reactjobs - nthroot and slowcompute to latest piest. version
    4.  Safer UI for demo - dropdown select numbers instead of entering (too big #s)
    5.  Think about a job Cancel button how would work - worker gets msg from gearman?
    6.  For some reason server pushes for progress were getting confused with multiple jobs active.
     - supposed to only send by job id.
    7.  why is 720 faster than 750?
        8.  Display current job status - Idle, Queued, in Progress etc. - DONE
        9.  Add verbiage - Parallel / HPC / Xeon Phi / CUDA to description in github
    10.  Handle JOB_STATUS.ERROR - in render()
    11. Workers need another message - send job was received.. ?
    12. We could also be QUEUED - and just waiting long time for hardware to become available.
    should this be part of Job Parameters - how long to wait for hardware?
